           <p>Cars are an essential mode of transportation used for leisure activities, work, or travelling purposes. Each new model of a car and its specific feature can determine its driving experience. Cars can be a safe way to commute to avoid close contact with the general public during pandemic situations. A car at home can be very beneficial in case of family health emergencies. Cars offer flexibility in travel and help maintain punctuality. However, since cars are expensive to buy and maintain, not everyone can afford one. </p>
